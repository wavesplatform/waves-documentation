# Standard Library

The **Standard Library** is a set of [built-in functions](/ride/functions/built-in-functions.md) of the [script context](/ride/script/script-context.md).

Versions of the Standard Library: — 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The version of the Standard Library used in the script is set by the `STDLIB_VERSION` [directive](/ride/script/directives.md).

It is advised to use version 3 of the Standard Library when developing applications; versions 1 and 2 are required for backward compatibility.

> [!WARNING]
> Standard Library Version 4 becomes available from node version 1.2.0, after activation of the "Ride V4 and multiple attached payments for Invoke Script Transaction" (No. 16) feature. See [Activation Protocol](/blockchain/waves-protocol/activation-protocol.md). Version 1.2.x is currently available on [Stagenet](/blockchain/blockchain-network/stage-network.md) only.
